            <h4>
                What is this website?
            </h4>
            <p>
                This website is only temporary. I've been wanting to make my own website for ages (even had one back in 2016, but I wish to forget about it). I tried making it with Blazor, React, [...]. It's a long story. Currently I'm writing my own template for Jekyll
                so that I can manage the <i>blog</i> part of the website easier (RSS included).
            </p>

            <h4>
                Why does this website look so basic?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I don't like bloated websites. I'm the type of person who cares if they download 2kBs or 20kBs as I'm usually using a limited mobile data plan. Plus, again, this website is simple by design, it's supposed to be fast, readable on any screen size and easy
                to maintain (from my experience, the less JavaScript the better).

            <h2>
                A little bit about me

            <h4>
                Who am I?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I'm Wojtek (diminutive of Wojciech), I'm 21 years old, currently studying Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://pwr.edu.pl/en/" target="_blank">Wrocław University of Science and Technology</a>. I do <u>many</u> things. Most of them
                related to computers and mathematics. On the internet I go by Senti or SentiWW, depends on which one wasn't taken.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Where are you from?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I'm from Poland! Originally I'm from the region called Silesia, but I currently live in Lower-Silesia because this is where I go to university. I'm quite proud to be Silesian as my region has a very rich history.

                Some of my interests
            </h2>

            <h4>
                What are some of your interests?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Saying I have a lot of interests is an understatement. I have a <u>lot</u> of them. I keep getting into new interesting things that I really want to explore further, but at this point 24 hours in a day isn't enough. The list below is in
                no particular order.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Video games
            </h4>
            <p>
                I have been playing video games since I was a kid. I'm not really keen on new games though as I think many of them lack good gameplay so I play slightly older games such as StarCraft II, Blitzkrieg, Underrail, Team Fortress 2, Dwarf Fortress and Star
                Sector. The newer games I play are Warhammer: Vermintide 2, Total War: WARHAMMER II and Noita.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Board games
            </h4>
            <p>
                I got into board games relatively recently, when I was around 17 years old, but I love them just as much as video games, if not more. My favorite board games are probably Root, Flux, and Dune.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Role-playing games
            </h4>
            <p>
                Role-playing games are hard for me. I really like them, but organizing them is a nightmare. Everyone in my friend group is busy at different times of the day, at different times of the week, but whenever I get to play I remember it for a long time. It's
                fun to get immersed into being a dwarven warrior for a couple of hours, no finals, no work. Just slaying goblins and orks (and whatever else happens to be around, to be honest). My favorite system is probably Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
                2 edition. I also played D&D but didn't have as much experience with it.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Bass guitar
            </h4>
            <p>
                I always liked the sound of bass guitars. I don't have a music education (and am not really planning to get one). Some time ago I got myself a bass guitar of my own (a red 4-string Ibanez SR300EB). I love this guitar so much it's unreal. Once again, I
                don't have a music education so I only play from tabs or chords. It's still a lot of fun, though, nothing calms me down more than playing for half an hour or more.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Hiking
            </h4>
            <p>
                To be completely honest. I never liked hiking, but for some reason I went on a long hike alone when I was around 16 years old. The weather was awful; it was raining for the majority of my hike. When I reached the top of the mountain I was aiming for,
                the weather cleared quite suddenly. The view was amazing; the air was fresh; there was no one at the top but me. I felt tranquility. Ever since that day I have fallen in love with hiking. I even did it in winter, which was an even better
                experience. Something about wearing literal spikes on your boots really makes you feel like you're a pioneer.
            </p>

            <h4>
                VHF/HF radio
            </h4>
            <p>
                I don't remember how I got into shortwave radio. I probably read about it somewhere and wanted to try it for myself. I currently have a software defined radio (RTL-SDR v3) and a 2 meter dipole antenna. It's not a great setup, but it's enough for my needs.
                I sometimes take it with me when traveling just to see what signals I can pick up from different parts of the world. When I finally get more free time, I plan to make an antenna of my own, hopefully one that can pick up signals around
                3MHz.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Arduino Uno
            </h4>
            <p>
                I think what inspired me to get into electronics such as the Arduino Uno was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CNLohr/featured" target="_blank">CNLohr</a>. I didn't have much time to make any big project with my Arduino Uno yet. So far
                I made a simple circuit with that beeps when a light sensor is covered. I plan to do something silly with it and collect roll/pitch/yaw data with it, if I'm able to do that, I will stick it in my car and make an API around it so that anyone
                can check how tilted my car is at any moment in time.
            </p>

                This website was made in around 2 hours. It has its fair share of problems. I know. The purpose of it is to act as a placeholder website while I work on something better and it fulfills that purpose beautifully. It was made entirely from scratch. It consists
                of 2 files, <i>index.html</i> and <i>style.css</i>. The only external resource I use is <b>FontAwesome</b> (for icons in the footer).

            <p>
                This project is <i>weird</i>. I made it around 3 months after Blizzard dropped support for StarCraft II. Some patch made after they gave up on the game made it take around 5 minutes to start. The game kept pinging some update server that
                wasn't responding, and the game needed it to start. I found the solution to this on some forum, turns out, if you turn off your internet connection for a moment, start the game, and turn it back on again, it will work without a problem.
                Okay, this seems like a job for a simple batch script, right? No. I decided to make a GUI for this (I don't know why). After a couple of months, out of curiosity, I checked if anyone had downloaded my project. Turns out it was downloaded
                <b>391</b> times!

                This is a little game my friend Jacob and I made for a gamejam in high school. The code is very hacky, but I wasn't as good of a programmer at the time as I am now. I remember this project very well as it was a great learning experience. It was the first
                time I used TypeScript. You can still play the game on <a href="https://tagis.itch.io/techni-jump" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.

            <p>
                This project was made during my first semester at university. I asked my professor if it was possible to complete the course early, he tasked me with making an object-oriented derivatives calculator in C++. It has some bugs but works in most cases.
